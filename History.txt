=== 0.2.0 / 2009-11-17

* New features:
  * results can use [] and []= for lookup and seting
  * allows results to be open structs (default) or hash (by requiring 'googleajax/as_hash' instead)

* bug fixes:
  * Search.web(...).count now returns an int, not a string
  * many calls were not passing the args argument to #get
  * Feed.load used to return an open struct with only one method called 'feed' that was a hash. It now returns the feed correctly.

* Behind the scene changes:
  * specs
  * shorter, cleaner code
  * links to google api doc in rdoc
  * most classes are now modules
  * small optimizations
  * All #get now requires arg (see bug fix)
